\begin{acknowledgements}
Above all, I thank my advisor, Kamalika, for her mentorship over the last five years. Kamalika will do anything in her power to help her students find what success means to them, and build towards it. She puts her students' futures above all else. Part of that is mentoring her students to become thoughtful researchers. In hindsight, I see that we could have pursued much lower risk projects that made incremental gains on the hottest research directions. Instead, Kamalika guided me towards unusual and challenging problems that required me to examine my fundamentals and reconsider broad questions about the aims of data privacy. In doing so, I not only understand what solutions are effective in data privacy, but why we as a research community use them and --- in some cases --- why we have ignored them. 

I cannot overemphasize the gratitude I have to my collaborators as well. First, to my collaborators at FAIR. I thank Chuan Guo for showing me how to navigate incredibly challenging and open-ended ML problems. His Socratic approach to mentoring helped me explore my own instincts and take ownership of the project without letting me slip down the wrong path. Florian Bordes taught me the ins and outs of contemporary vision modeling. Pascal Vincent's insights on how to design deep learning experiments were truly formative; I sincerely appreciate his effort and time. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Ashwin Machanavajjhala at Tumult for mentoring me on how how to reason about different privacy definitions and guarantees in applied settings. 

Finally, to all of my friends. To the lab: I could not have landed in a better group. To be surrounded by such wonderful and bright companions is a win --- for them to be your colleagues as well is a gift. To all my dear pre-PhD friends (you know who you are, and you really don't have read this dissertation): you are the loves of my life!

% Put your maximum 350 word abstract here.
\begin{dissertationabstract}
%The Abstract begins here. The abstract is limited to 350 words for a
%doctoral dissertation. It should consist of a short statement of the
%problem, a brief explanation of the methods and procedures employed in
%generating the data, and a condensed summary of the findings of the
%study. The abstract may continute onto a second page if necessary. The
%text of the abstract must be double spaced.
As data collection for machine learning (ML) tasks has become more pervasive, it has also become more heterogeneous: we share our writing, images, voices, and location online every day. Naturally, the associated privacy risks are just as complex and variable. My research advances practical data privacy through two avenues: 1) drafting provable privacy definitions and mechanisms for safely sharing data in different ML domains, and 2) empirically quantifying how ML models memorize their sensitive training data and thereby risk disclosing it. This dissertation details the various data domains/tasks considered, and the corresponding privacy methods proposed.

%\chapter{An ordinary page}
%The purpose of this page is to illustrate an ordinary page of text in
%a doctoral dissertation or master's thesis. All pages of the doctoral
%dissertation or master's thesis must be kept within the margins of
%1.5'' on the left, 1'' on the right, 1'' on the top and 1.25'' on the
%bottom. All text must be double spaced except as indicated below.
%
%It is recommended that to increase the margins as paper can shift in a
%printer and as some photocopiers tend to increase the image being
%copied.
%
%The first line of each paragraph must be indented at least one 0.5''
%tab, as done here.
%
%This text is intended to be a part of the dissertation, for a doctoral
%student, or the thesis if you are receiving a master's degree, and now
%a quote is included here:
%\begin{quote}
%All quotes of more than six lines, even though this one is not, are to
%be indented 0.5'' from the left and 0.5'' from the right. These longer
%quotes are to be single spaced. Don't forget to adjust for proper
%spacing after the last line of the quoted material.
%\end{quote}
%The rest of the paragraph would continue as so.
